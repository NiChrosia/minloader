# Usage

To actually run Mindustry with minloader, there are a few steps involved.
- Firstly, you need to create an instance. This can be done using `minloader new <name>`
- Secondly, you need to install a version. This is done using `minloader install <version>`. Some examples of such versions are `v137` and `v126.2`.
- Finally, to run Mindustry, use `minloader run <instance> <version> <platform>`. The first two parameters are from steps 1-2, and platform is either `desktop` or `server`, depending on which you want to use.
